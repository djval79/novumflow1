# 💰 ROI Calculator

## Interactive ROI Calculator Components

### Input Variables
1. **Company Size**: Number of employees
2. **Average HR Team Size**: FTE HR professionals
3. **Average Hourly Rate**: £25 (default, adjustable)
4. **Current Recruitment Volume**: Hires per year
5. **Average Time to Hire**: Weeks (current state)
6. **Current HR Tools**: Number of separate systems
7. **Compliance Penalties**: Annual risk/cost

### Calculation Logic

#### Time Savings (Annual)
```
Manual Hours Saved = HR Team Size × 60 hours/week × 52 weeks
Value = Manual Hours Saved × Average Hourly Rate
```

#### Recruitment Efficiency (Annual)  
```
Faster Hiring = Recruitment Volume × (Current Time - New Time) × Cost per Delayed Position
Typical Improvement = 50% time reduction
Cost per Week Delay = £2,500 (industry average)
```

#### Tool Consolidation (Annual)
```
Current Tool Costs = Number of Tools × £500/month average
NOVUMFLOW Replaces = 5-8 tools typically
Savings = (Replaced Tools × £500 × 12) - NOVUMFLOW Annual Cost
```

#### Compliance Risk Reduction (Annual)
```
Avoided Penalties = Historical Penalties + Risk Assessment
Home Office Fines = £10,000-50,000 per violation
DBS Compliance Issues = £5,000-25,000 impact
```

### Sample ROI Calculation (100 Employee Company)

#### Inputs
- **Employees**: 100

- **Hourly Rate**: £25
- **Recruitment**: 20 hires/year
- **Time to Hire**: 8 weeks currently
- **Current Tools**: 6 separate systems
- **NOVUMFLOW Plan**: Professional (£150/month)

#### Calculations

**Time Savings:**
- Hours Saved: 2 × 60 × 52 = 6,240 hours
- Value: 6,240 × £25 = £156,000

**Recruitment Efficiency:**
- Time Reduction: 8 weeks → 4 weeks = 4 weeks saved
- Value: 20 × 4 × £2,500 = £200,000

**Tool Consolidation:**
- Current Cost: 6 × £500 × 12 = £36,000
- NOVUMFLOW Cost: £150 × 12 = £1,800
- Savings: £34,200

**Compliance:**
- Risk Reduction: £15,000 (conservative estimate)
