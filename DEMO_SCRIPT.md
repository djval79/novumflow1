## 💬 Common Questions & Answers

### "What makes this different from competitors?"

> "Most care tech platforms focus on either HR OR care management. We've built both, integrated from day one. Plus, we're building on modern tech (Supabase, React, AI) which means faster iteration and lower costs."

### "What's the pricing model?"

> "Per-user, per-month. Typical care home: £X/month for the full suite. ROI typically achieved within 3 months through reduced compliance violations and administrative savings."

### "How long to implement?"

> "Initial setup: 1 week. Full data migration: 2-4 weeks depending on complexity. We offer guided onboarding and training."

### "Is it CQC compliant?"

> "Yes. CareFlow is designed with CQC requirements in mind. Automated audit trails, care notes, medication administration records, and incident reporting all support regulatory compliance."
