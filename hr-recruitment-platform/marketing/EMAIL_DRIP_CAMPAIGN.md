## Email 3: Social Proof / Case Study
**Subject:** How [Agency Name] reduced admin time by 40%
**Timing:** Day 7

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

"We used to spend every Friday just checking expiry dates. Now, NovumFlow tells us what needs attention on Monday morning."

That’s what one of our early adopters told us last week. By automating the "boring stuff" (DBS checks, RTW dates, Training renewals), you free up your team to focus on what matters: your people and your clients.

Ready to activate your automated compliance engine?

Cheers,
The NovumFlow Team
